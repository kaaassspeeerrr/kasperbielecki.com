    <h2>Space and Materiality</h2>
    <h3>Kimberly Tate</h3>
    <p>Building is an act of transformation. How do we translate a thought into a thing? How do we take an idea from a flat world to a three-dimensional world? In this class you will learn the techniques of physical construction: joining, inserting, interlocking, nesting, slotting, folding, collapsing. You will also come to understand how force, resistance and gravity affect construction. Space / Materiality will look at three types of space: haptic (related to touch); inhabited (lived in or occupied space); and social and environmental (related to society and the natural world). We embrace learning through failure, taking a trial and error approach to finding out about material properties. We will experiment with concepts such as malleability, weight, texture, durability, and think about ways to engage all the senses as we create three-dimensional projects. Discussion, critique, and written responses will create a class community of idea-sharing. These will help you to understand your work in historical and cultural contexts, including the social and ecological impacts of the materials you use. This section will be framed through the keyword “body.” A body is a physical form that contains living beings. When we refer to “the body,” whose body are we referencing? How do we understand the complexities and nuances of individual bodies within the context of culture, community, history and language? This section will focus on how bodies have an impact on our surroundings and the objects within it. How do ergonomics, structure, and self-image correspond to the shape, movement and impact of the human form? We will use a range of methods to explore concepts of personal space, costuming and decorating the body, and how objects function in relationship to the body.
