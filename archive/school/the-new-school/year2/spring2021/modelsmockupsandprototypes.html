    <h3>Michael Verbos</h3>
    <p>This course aims to educate students to shop etiquette and culture and instruct appropriate and safe use of hand and power tools/machines in construction classrooms. This course supports design-build processes in core studios throughout the entire program sequence. This course is integrated with the design studio with various project touch points. Focus is on hands-on full-scale and scaled making, choosing an appropriate modeling method for the intended purpose, experimentation versus planning, trial and error process documentation, and an introduction to rapid-prototyping and outsourced fabrication. Course work is done in construction classrooms.
