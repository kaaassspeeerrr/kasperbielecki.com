    <h2>Materials and Manufacturing Processes</h2>
    <h3>Barent Roth and Erika Doering</h3>
    <p>In this course students will be introduced to basic knowledge of materials and processes commonly used by product designers and manufacturers at various scales of production. This course informs the design studio sequence by providing a foundation for understanding how a product works and how it can be made better, safer, and more sustainably. As a seminar, assignments will be both individual and team based, and will include a number of on-site field-trips.
