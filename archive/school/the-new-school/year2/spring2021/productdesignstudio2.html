    <h2>Product Design Studio 2</h2>
    <h3>Dave Marin and Kim Markel</h3>
    <p>In this course students are introduced to design as a means to communicate ideas to multiple audiences through application of product semantics - distinguishing between self-perception and how others read design artifacts. This course builds heavily upon prior learning by requiring analysis of design history, application of shop and modeling skills, as well as representational presentation. Through numerous fast-paced short projects, students will explore varying degrees of development, and explore how a projectâ€™s time-frame and audience influence the degree of finish.
