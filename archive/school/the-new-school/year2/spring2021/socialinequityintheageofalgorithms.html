    <h2>Social Inequity in The Age of Algorithms</h2>
    <h3>Zoe Carey</h3>
    <p>This course will analyze the multifarious ways in which social, cultural and political inequalities are produced and reinforced within the structures and pathways of the digital world. It will interrogate social inequalities in terms of class, gender, and race, and provide an overview of how the asymmetries perpetuated in the digital world impact these social formations. This course will underline how the digital sphere also creates territorial or place based inequalities, given the lack of access to resources and infrastructures in the Global South. It will outline the broad parameters of the digital sphere and focus on the ways in which the digital media has shaped public discourse through the survey of a variety of media infrastructures like internet platforms, everyday apps, and social media sites. Showcasing the prevalent conversations on these sites, this course will question the given assumptions of framing the Internet as a vast arena of unrestricted communication and freely exchanged information instead of being a highly regulated and structured virtual space. It will highlight discussions that point out how the algorithms, codes and technical protocols that make network connections (and disconnections) possible, are founded in the principles of power and control, through relevant information about the digital commons, open source, intellectual property rights, and the block-chain bubble etc. The course will also introduce the students to the new ways in which tech bias, data science and ethics are being meaningfully addressed by the ideas of intersectional feminism, race activism and digital labor movements in the virtual sphere.
