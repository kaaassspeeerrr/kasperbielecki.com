    <h2>Radical Software</h2>
    <h3>Rory Solomon</h3>
    <p>This hybrid theory/practice seminar will trace the history of radical, activist, and countercultural uses of software and digital technology. From the milieu surrounding the Whole Earth Catalog, to hacker collectives such as Anonymous, to recent art and activism, we will explore efforts that have attempted to deploy software and its networks as anti-authoritarian or counter-hegemonic techniques. We will examine concepts that undergird the commitments of such actions, such as liberalism, freedom, sovereignty, and direct action. And we will consider industry discourse to ask whether and how we might distinguish between radical software and corporate marketing messages around “disruption.” Readings will include texts by authors such as Mackenzie Wark, Fred Turner, Gabriella Coleman, Alex Galloway, and Ruha Benjamin. Coursework will include hands-on projects comprised of creative and critical use and misuse of software and computer code. No prior computer programming experience is necessary.
