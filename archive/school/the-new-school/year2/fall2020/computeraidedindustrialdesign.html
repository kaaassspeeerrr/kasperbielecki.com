    <h3>Yeon Jung Roh</h3>
    <p>This course introduces two-dimensional and three-dimensional graphic software for application to sketching, testing, rendering and design control drawing. This fundamental course presents baseline software platforms from which students will continue to build-upon and hone throughout their education.  The course includes free-form surface modeling as well as parametric constraints typical of Computer Aided Design (CAD) of which CAID is a subset.  Deliverables include output to 3D printer, laser-cutter, as well as creation of Design Control Drawings (DCD) to later interface with outside venders.
