    <h2>Product Design Studio 4</h2>
    <h3>Peter Allen</h3>
    <p>In this course, students will conduct actionable user research - applying testing to create designed outcomes. This transitional studio bridges learning in Human Factors, Ergonomics & Interface with previous studies around form giving and production. Students will be given opportunity to work with outside partners or advisors and will demonstrate ability to work both individually as well as on a team. While project work will be primarily studio based, content may require off-site research and engagement. </p>
