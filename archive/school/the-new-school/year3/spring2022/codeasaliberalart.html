    <h2>Code as a Liberal Art</h2>
    <h3>Rory Solomon and Joshua Scannell</h3>
    <p>n this hybrid theory/practice seminar students will both critically examine, and learn how to craft, the code that drives computational machinery, focusing on its relevance to the domains of the liberal arts: the humanities, the arts, and the social and physical sciences. Students will learn the fundamentals of computational systems and ways that they relate to critical thinking and creative practice including: “distant reading” and the digital humanities, the production of generative artwork, techniques in data forensics, and methods for investigating algorithmic bias. Coursework will include weekly exercises using Python & Javascript. No prior coding experience is required. Students will need to bring a laptop computer to class, and can check one out from the university if necessary. This class fulfills the core requirement for the Code as a Liberal Art minor.</p>
