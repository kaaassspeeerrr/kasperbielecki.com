    <h2>After Religion</h2>
    <h3>Mark Larrimore and Greer Bateman</h3>
    <p>In the time of the Anthropocene, religion is resurgent - but not in the forms most observers expected. Westernized young people reject religion in favor of ""spirituality"" while inherited traditions throughout the world are being displaced by charismatic new communities often at violent odds with the institutions of modernity. The mythology of ""world religions"" obscures the religious past as well as modern religion's relationship with the structures of the liberal state and imperialism. An increasingly unpredictable climate undermines political and cultural structures once taken for granted, bringing new visibility to the wisdom of indigenous traditions, and even perhaps creating new gods. Meanwhile, most cultural theorists rub their eyes that religion still hasn't disappeared! This course surveys the contemporary religious landscape to consider what part religious discourses, practices and communities may play in an increasingly unsettled future. Students must register for both the lecture and discussion section of this course. [This ULEC is in category 3, Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Arts and Humanities.]
