    <p>This course will look at how closely intertwined sports has been with the overall physical and social development of New York City, and how the city's sports facilities, from early baseball fields to Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium, have been an intrinsic part of its history. We will look not only at these places as shapers of the city's urban form, but as reflections of its character. Readings will connect discussion of the city's physical growth with the spirit and culture of New York fandom. [This ULEC is in category 3, Interdisciplinary Approaches to the Arts and Humanities.] </p>
