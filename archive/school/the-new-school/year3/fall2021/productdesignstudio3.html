    <h3>Dave Marin</h3>
    <p>This course aims to recognize opportunities for designers to use digital fabrication technologies that leverage the possibilities of the technology in order to deliver stakeholder benefits. The course has a heavy emphasis on material exploration and exercises knowledge learned in Materials & Manufacturing Processes, Computer-Aided Industrial Design and Design Studio 1 and 2. Students will be working both individually and collaboratively towards comprehending the difference between fundamental innovation and incremental change in their work as well as beginning to articulate the relationship of manufacturing/fabrication processes to larger societal contexts.</p>
