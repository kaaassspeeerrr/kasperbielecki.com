    <h2>Time</h2>
    <h3>Rory Solomon</h3>
    <p>In this class we will explore the “idea” of time. How do we track time? How is it experienced in the real world? How is it experienced in a piece of art? Throughout the semester, you will engage with the idea that time is a malleable concept. When you begin to consider the cultural and perceptual constructions of time, it becomes a material whose properties you can learn to manipulate and use in your work. You will be introduced to time-based media, including InDesign (time across the page) and Premiere Pro (time in motion). Through these programs and others you will learn to create layouts for print, as well as edit and shoot video. You will experiment with attention span, duration, linear and non-linear narratives. Studio projects, readings, writing and examples of many artists’ work are used to examine how our ideas about time have evolved. The course encourages a spirit of play and experimentation. How does time impact our sense of memory and identity in ways that can influence our art, design and strategic thinking processes? </p>
